Computer Vision Based Ping Pong Game
This project involves a simple Ping Pong Game in which the paddles are controlled with the position magenta coloured objects tracked by the Laptop Camera.
There are funny sounds played when the ping pong ball touches the wall and objects.
I have used Tracking.JS (Javascript Framework) for computer vision.
It was just a hobby project made just in a day.
